# Joker Game Statistics App

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive application designed to provide detailed statistical analysis and data management for the Joker game, a popular lottery in Greece. It features data retrieval, storage, and presentation of draw results, along with an in-depth statistical analysis of draw numbers. It was a collaborative effort as part of a group assignment during the 3rd year Object-Oriented Programming/Java classes at the university. 
Special thanks to my co-creators, Nikolaos Psyllou and Skliris Dionysis for their significant contributions. 
We utilized GitHub for version control and adopted Agile/Scrum techniques to efficiently manage the development process. This project is a testament to our collective learning and teamwork.

## Features
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches draw data from the OPAP API for specified date ranges.
- **Database Integration**: Uses DerbyDB for storing and managing draw data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Offers detailed statistics on draw numbers, including occurrences and delays.
- **PDF Reporting**: Generates PDF reports of the statistical analysis for print or distribution.
- **User Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for interacting with the application.
